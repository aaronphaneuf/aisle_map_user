## What is AisleMap?
AisleMap is simply a heat map of product on a shelf. Sales data is displayed in the same placement as it appears on your
physical display, because the product is entered left to right.

## What is the purpose of AisleMap?
AisleMap is meant as a tool to aid those who merchandise and order product. On the merchandising side, top selling product
could be switched to the bottom shelf, often without loss of sales and lower selling product could be moved to eye level, as a strategy to increase sales. For ordering, sales data is essential to balancing having enough stock and minimizing loss.

## What is AisleMap (User Generated)?
All point-of-sale systems differ in the way the data is extracted. While mine uses SQL, yours may use something
different. I created this specific version of AisleMap to more easily aid one to adding their own data source. Whether that
is an external connection to a database or a script that reads some automatically generated text, this version (combined with
some examples from the full version) should help you with that.

## Requirements

filehere.py requires python 3.x and the following modules:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Usage

Since this is a basic version of linktofilehere, item information is 100% generated by the user, with advice on expanding below. My point of sale supplier allows me to export item information including sales data for a specific period.

### sales_data.txt
Although I use SQL for this, as an example of obtaining the data manually, my POS allows me to filter specific items, date ranges, and stores to obtain a csv that looks like the following:

</p>

for sales_data.txt, I only care about Item ID and Quantity Sold, so I create a text file with just those two columns, separated by tab.

## store_scan.txt

This combines the only file that linkofilehere takes as input as combines it with item info, once again pulled form your external source. A tab separated file with the following information is created by the user:

Item ID (UPC), Amount of Facings (see internal language), Brand, Name, Size

The amount of facings that an item contains is entered in the following column.
1 facing = 1, 2 facings = 2, etc.

Brand, Name, and Size are easily obtained through my POS's web application.

Whenever there is a shelf break, insert one of the following codes:

77985, 77986, 77987, 77988, 77989, 77990, 77991, 77992, 77993, 77994, 77995, 77996, 77997, 77998, 77999

So that the script knows how present the map to replicate the shelf.

Once the two files above are created, running aisle_map_user.py will generate
an html file titled heatmap.html:
